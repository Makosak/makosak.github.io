‘Risk environment’ frameworks model aspects of drug-related harm based on empirical and theoretical work about social, political and epidemiologic interactions between individuals (or groups) and place. Investigations of urban populations have uncovered racialized risk environments among vulnerable subpopulations that may drive and/or magnify disparities in people who inject drugs (PWID). Much remains unknown in rural risk environments, despite a growing crisis in these areas, including how complex geographic patterns of sparse job opportunities, dangerous conditions in existing jobs, housing, physical landscape, population density, and other factors impact vulnerability. We adapt a risk environment framework to characterize rural southern Illinois and describe the relations of risk environments, opioid-related overdose, HIV, Hepatitis C, and sexually transmitted infection rates between 2012 and 2016.
 
We study social, economic, policy, and physical aspects of the risk environment. Over two dozen variables are summarized by mean across zip-code (n=128) or county levels (n=16) based on availability and theoretical relevance. For example, we include isolation, high-risk employment (eg. mining, construction), extreme poverty, land-use, housing, and residential areal characteristics. We also calculate and compare multiple access variables to nearest primary care providers, pharmacies, harm reduction programs, and urgent care facilities. We then use an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) approach to characterize both data attributes and geographic dimensions of the rural risk environment. Finally, we compare the exposure to risk environment and health outcomes across regional clusters.
 
Both risk environment vulnerabilities and health outcomes are multifaceted and spatially heterogeneous in the rural southern Illinois. Health outcome clusters vary across space according to type, despite similarities in several dimensions of the risk environment. Opioid-related deaths increase over time and shift patterns geographically. Racialized risk factors were not as significant at explaining variations in health outcomes as several socioeconomic and landscape characteristics.
 
Geographically diverse rural environments present unique challenges to understanding risk environments and associated health outcomes. Some areas with high vulnerability may have mitigating protective factors that reduce poor outcomes. Future research may require more localized analysis, and must better address methodological challenges in sparsely populated locations. Policies improving economic opportunity and access to related health services should be further investigated.
