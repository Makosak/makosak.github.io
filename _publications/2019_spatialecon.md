Spatial effects violate the so-called stable unit treatment value assumption advanced by Rubin 
as part of the foundational framework for empirical
treatment effect analysis. In this article, we consider the role of spatial effects more
closely. We provide a brief overview of a number of attempts to extend existing
econometric treatment effect evaluation methods with an accounting for spatial
aspects and outline and illustrate an alternative approach. Specifically, we propose a
spatially explicit counterfactual framework that leverages spatial panel econometrics
to account for both SD and SH in treatment choice, treatment variation, and treatment effects. 
We illustrate this framework with a replication of a well-known treatment effect analysis, 
that is, the evaluation effect of minimum legal drinking age laws on
mortality for US states during the period 1970â€“1984, a classic textbook example of
applied causal inference. We replicate the results available in the literature and
compare these to a range of alternative specifications that incorporate spatial effects
