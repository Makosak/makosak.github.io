excerpt: ' In this cross-sectional, multiple-methods study of 3932 census tracts, black majority census tracts were more likely than white majority census tracts to be located in a trauma desert in Chicago, Illinois (odds ratio, 8.48), and Los Angeles, California (odds ratio, 5.11). A residual direct effect was detected in New York City, New York (adjusted odds ratio, 1.87), after adjusting for poverty and race-poverty interaction effects.'

Is there an association between race/ethnicity and access to trauma care in US cities?

In this cross-sectional, multiple-methods study of 3932 census tracts, black majority census tracts were more likely than white majority census tracts to be located in a trauma desert in Chicago, Illinois (odds ratio, 8.48), and Los Angeles, California (odds ratio, 5.11). A residual direct effect was detected in New York City, New York (adjusted odds ratio, 1.87), after adjusting for poverty and race-poverty interaction effects.

This study suggests that black majority census tracts may be the only racial/ethnic group with consistent disparities in geographic access to trauma centers.
