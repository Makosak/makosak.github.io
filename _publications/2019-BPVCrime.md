Serial observations were abstracted from the EHR at an academic medical center and paired to the City of Chicago Police Data Portal. The violent crime rate (VCR) was calculated as the number of violent crimes per 1000 population per year for each census tract. Longitudinal multilevel regression models were implemented to assess elevated BP (systolic BP≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP≥90 mmHg) as a function of the VCR, adjusting for patient characteristics, neighborhood characteristics, and time effects.
