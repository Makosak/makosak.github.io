Earlier this summer I was so honored to be accepted to the 2019 TRELIS cohort. 
<a href="https://www.ucgis.org/trelis.html">TRELIS</a> is professional development for women in the geospatial sciences in higher education. Training and Retaining Leaders in STEM - Geospatial Sciences (TRELIS-GS) instills the concept of a human capital trellis or scaffold of support, and represents the reality of nonlinear career trajectories that move sideways, take leaps, and do not follow a single upward ladder. 


It was a true honor and pleasure to connect with other TRELIS fellows at our workshop in Washington, D.C. in June. I look forward to further connecting with and building on this amazing group of women!
