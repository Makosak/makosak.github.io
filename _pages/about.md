I investigate issues of equity across space and time using applied spatial econometrics and statistics with policy-driven, systems-integrating solutions. I’m currently the Assistant Director of Health Informatics at the Center for Spatial Data Science at University of Chicago, where I also teach full time as a Lecturer in Geographic Information Science.

My current research intersects domains of food access, public health, and housing.

My favorite tools are python, R, javascript, & POSTGIS. I’m also very interested in supporting elegant, powerful systems infrastructure for (big) spatial data and dynamic analysis. My graduate research in GIS at John Hopkins University emphasized social science modeling, knowledge engineering, and sound data infrastructures. In my PhD studies with the GeoDa Center at Arizona State University, I continued to work with data in geospatial analysis and modeling, further integrating dynamic decision science with causal inference & spatial effects research.


My Background
======
A lot of people ask me how I found my place in studying "place" with social science thinking and geographic data science. I was trained as a geologist... 

I also enjoy writing lyrical nonfiction and poetry, and received my M.F.A. in writing from Roosevelt in 2011. I love my records almost as much as my terminal, as well as my family, Polish poster art, travel whenever possible, and mountain hikes.
